			{{SITE_NAME}} is a website created to aid UofC students in their program course planning. It has a <a
				href="{{url_for('view.courseBrowser')}}">Course Browser</a> that allows users to quickly look through
			the university's full course catalog, with intuitive filter and sorting options. Each course has an
			individual page with all the essential information for students, and a comment section for course-related
			discussions. With an optional account, users can save courses with custom tags and add them to a virtual <a
				href="{{url_for('view.planner')}}">Course Planner</a>, where they can be arranged into their respective
			terms. The Planner will show an interactive GPA calculator and the current progress of the student.
			<br>
			{{SITE_NAME}} also offers a public Web <a href="{{url_for('view.api')}}">API</a> to easily retrieve Grade,
			Term, Faculty, Subject and Course data within your own application. The available endpoints are listed in
			the <a href="{{url_for('view.api')}}">API documentation</a>.
			<br>
			We plan to regularly add many more features that will keep on improving students' experience making the best
			choices for their career plan.

			<h2>Why?</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-10 pe-xxl-5">
			{{SITE_NAME}} was inspired by the need for a better system for browsing and looking for courses. The
			University's official medium for searching for course information, the Calendar, has been <a
				href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090908124154/http://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/course-by-faculty.html">practically
				left untouched since 2009</a> (according to the Wayback Machine). In terms of functionality, the
			official Calendar makes it hard to sort through the selection of courses available without any filtering
			functionality. Even with a good course browsing experience, students are left on their own to select their
			desired courses and plan them in a coherent way. {{SITE_NAME}} aims to provide a uniform experience for
			general course planning that adapts to every student, with more features to come.
