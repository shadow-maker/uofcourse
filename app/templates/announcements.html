        {{SITE_NAME}} is a website created to aid UofC students in their program course planning. The <a
            href="{{url_for('view.courseBrowser')}}">Course Browser</a> allows users to quickly browse through the
        university's full course catalog, with intuitive filter and sorting options. By clicking on any course in the
        Course Browser, the course's view page opens with all the essential information for students. With an optional
        account, users can save courses with custom tags and add them to a virtual Course Planner. In the <a
            href="{{url_for('view.planner')}}">Course Planner</a>, students can arrange courses in all the terms they
        have been enrolled in, and are planning on enrolling in the future. Grades can be added to courses inside terms
        that have concluded, and the GPA for the term will be automatically calculated.
        <br>
        {{SITE_NAME}} also offers a public Web <a href="{{url_for('view.api')}}">API</a> to easily retrieve Grade, Term,
        Faculty, Subject and Course data within your own application. The available endpoints are listed in the <a
            href="{{url_for('view.api')}}">API documentation</a>.
        <br>
        We plan to regularly add many more features that will keep on improving students' experience making the best
        choices for their career plan.

        <h2>Why?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-10 pe-xxl-5">
        {{SITE_NAME}} was inspired by the lack of ability in the university's public and official <a
            href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/course-by-faculty.html">medium for browsing through
            courses</a>. Design-wise, according to the Wayback Machine, the site has been <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090908124154/http://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/course-by-faculty.html">practically
            left untouched since 2009!</a> More than a decade later, it's clear that a website every student is meant to
        use requires a modern refresh. In terms of functionality, the website makes it hard to sort through the
        selection of courses available without any filtering functionality. Even with a good course browsing experience,
        it is expected that students find their own resources to organize their selected and desired courses.
        {{SITE_NAME}} aims to provide a uniform experience for general course planning that adapts to every student,
        with more features to come.

        The back-end of this website was developed in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> using the <a
            href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">Flask</a> micro web framework. To store all the site data,
        including user data, a relational <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> database is used and connected to
        Flask using the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com">SQLAlchemy</a> library. User-sensitive
        data, like passwords, are stored as a hash using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">Bcrypt</a>
        hashing algorithm. Front-end-wise, the layout and design of this website was created using the <a
